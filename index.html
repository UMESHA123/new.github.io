                <p class="first-content" style="text-indent: 2rem;">While there
                    are a ton of React courses
                    avaliable for you to
                    choose from, none compare to this course. Insted of focusing
                    on wrting code and building one large project this course is
                    focused on learing React and what the code you are writing
                    does. I focus on simplifying and explaining in depth every
                    complex React topic so you have a deep understanding of how
                    to build any product you can dream of. This means that
                    instead of mindlessly copying the code from the video you
                    will be actively learning each and everytopic covered</p>

                <p class="first-content"> I also utilize my extreme passion for
                    clean and weel-designed code to show you all the best
                    practices and design patterns you need to know in order to
                    easily create applicayions. This is something most other
                    courses never every talk about, let alone cover in the depth
                    I do.</p>
                <p class="first-content"> I could go on for hours about why this
                    course is the best choice for you, but in essence, if you
                    buy this course you will <b>lear more in less time</b>which
                    leads to you building your own projects quicker.</p>

                    of the most essential
                    features of React. Everything from JSX, and Hooks, to
                    Classes and Context will be covered. This first project is
                    focused on understaing and learning React so there will be
                    much more Explanation and examples than actual project code.
                    This will set us up to dive deep into the second main

                    you what code to write we will be taking through the code

                <p class="first-content" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"> This
                    course was recoreded in August of
                    2019 using React 16.8.6. This means that this course focuses
                    heaving on modern React concept such as hooks and context</p>

                <p class="first-content" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">No. This
                    courseis focused purely on
                    learning React, because trying to learn Recat alongside
                    things like Redux, or TypeScrpit makes learning React
                    exponentially more difficult. After taking this course and
                    learning React in depth adding on Redux or TypeScript is
                    much easier, and will lead to you learning other topics more
                    in depth and quicker.</p>
                <p class="h5-heading">Why is this course so short? Other React
                    courses are 20+ hours long?</p>
                <p class="first-content" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"> Yes. This
                    course is significantly
                    shorter than many other React courses, but that is actually
                    one of this course's biggest benifits. Since this course is
                    focused 100% on only React it is able to fit detailed
                    breakdowns and explanations of everything you need to know
                    aboue React into a fraction of the time of many other
                    courses. This means you will learn more in less time,
                    because not a sigle not a single minute of your time is
                    wasted in this course.</p>
                <p class="h5-heading">Why is this course more expensive than
                    other React courses on platform such as Udemy</p>
                <p class="first-content" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This
                    course is prices at a primium
                    price point to align with the high quality content in the
                    course. Many cheap courses are no more than long glorified
                    code alongs with very little explanation or exclusively on
                    the single goa; of teaching you React in the quickest and
                    most comprehensive way possible. This is achived via deep
                    explanations of every concept covered and every line of code
                    written. Unlike other cheaper courses the goal of this
                    course is not to teach tou to build one single product, but
                    instead this courses is ablout teaching you React so you can
                    create any product you can imagine and get you one step
                    closer toyour dream job.</p>
